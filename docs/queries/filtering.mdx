description: "Advanced WHERE conditions and operators"
---

Filter data using WHERE clauses with various operators.

## Comparison Operators
```sql
:GET User WHERE age = 25
:GET User WHERE age != 25
:GET User WHERE age > 21
:GET User WHERE age >= 21
:GET User WHERE age < 65
:GET User WHERE age <= 65
```

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `=` | Equal |
| `!=` | Not equal |
| `>` | Greater than |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal |
| `<` | Less than |
| `<=` | Less than or equal |

## Logical Operators

### AND
```sql
:GET User WHERE age > 21 AND status = "active"
```

| Database | Output |
|----------|--------|
| PostgreSQL | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 21 AND status = 'active'` |
| MongoDB | `db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 21 }, status: 'active' })` |

### OR
```sql
:GET User WHERE role = "admin" OR role = "moderator"
```

| Database | Output |
|----------|--------|
| PostgreSQL | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = 'admin' OR role = 'moderator'` |
| MongoDB | `db.users.find({ $or: [{ role: 'admin' }, { role: 'moderator' }] })` |

### Combined with Parentheses
```sql
:GET User WHERE (age > 21 AND status = "active") OR role = "admin"
```

## IN Operator

Match against a list of values.
```sql
:GET User WHERE role IN ("admin", "moderator", "editor")
```

| Database | Output |
|----------|--------|
| PostgreSQL | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE role IN ('admin', 'moderator', 'editor')` |
| MongoDB | `db.users.find({ role: { $in: ['admin', 'moderator', 'editor'] } })` |

### NOT IN
```sql
:GET User WHERE status NOT IN ("banned", "suspended")
```

## BETWEEN Operator

Match a range of values.
```sql
:GET User WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 65
```

| Database | Output |
|----------|--------|
| PostgreSQL | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 65` |
| MongoDB | `db.users.find({ age: { $gte: 18, $lte: 65 } })` |

### Date Range
```sql
:GET Order WHERE created_at BETWEEN "2024-01-01" AND "2024-12-31"
```

### NOT BETWEEN
```sql
:GET Product WHERE price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 50
```

## LIKE Operator

Pattern matching for strings.
```sql
:GET User WHERE name LIKE "John%"
:GET User WHERE email LIKE "%@gmail.com"
:GET User WHERE name LIKE "%smith%"
```

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `John%` | Starts with "John" |
| `%@gmail.com` | Ends with "@gmail.com" |
| `%smith%` | Contains "smith" |

| Database | Output |
|----------|--------|
| PostgreSQL | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'John%'` |
| MongoDB | `db.users.find({ name: { $regex: '^John' } })` |

### NOT LIKE
```sql
:GET User WHERE email NOT LIKE "%@test.com"
```

### ILIKE (Case Insensitive)
```sql
:GET User WHERE name ILIKE "john%"
```

| Database | Output |
|----------|--------|
| PostgreSQL | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name ILIKE 'john%'` |
| MySQL | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE 'john%'` |

## NULL Checks
```sql
:GET User WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
:GET User WHERE phone IS NOT NULL
```

| Database | Output |
|----------|--------|
| PostgreSQL | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` |
| MongoDB | `db.users.find({ deleted_at: null })` |

## Complex Example
```sql
:GET id, name, email FROM User 
  WHERE status = "active" 
  AND age BETWEEN 21 AND 45 
  AND role IN ("user", "premium") 
  AND email LIKE "%@company.com"
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
```
